# Hand Gesture Recognition
## Danny Lindberg and Nick Littlefield

### Overview
A deep learning computer vision application to detect a series of hand gestures such as Okay, Like (Thumb Up), Dislike (Thumb Down), and Stop (Palm). 

### Materials and Methods
#### Datasets
Two datasets were used to build different verisons. 

#### Leap Motion Dataset
Consists of black and white images of different hand gestures. We were only interested in the images for Okay, Thumb Up, and Palm. We extracted these images from the dataset to use in our project. The dataset didn't have any images for dislike, so these images were generated by flipping the thumbs up images. In total, there were 7,601 images. We split the dataset into a training/validation/test set using a 70/20/10 split.

#### TinyHGR Dataset
The TinyHGR dataset has images for 7 different hand gestures done by 40 different participants. This dataset is large, so we extracted the four hand gestures were interested in: Okay, Thumb Up, and Palm. Once fully extracted we had 134, 292 images. This was too many image for us to train a model on in Google Colab, so we took a random subset of the data. This instead gave us 33,574 images to work with. We used a 60/25/15 split to generate the training/validation/test set.

#### Libraries 
For this project we used the PyTorch, OpenCV, Pandas, and Numpy libraries. The entire project is built on top of pre-trained models that were downloaded from the PyTorch library. These include:
- ResNet18
- ResNet50
- Inception V3
